                    <h1>A description of my hobby:</h1>
                    <p>For my hobby I must first give you an insight into a block chain technology. It is about Cardano. Cardano is more than just a crypto-currency, it is a platform that will be able to run financial applications that can be used worldwide and is completely decentralized. Cardano will also be able to run DAPPS (decentralized applications).
                        Cardano will be developed by 3 organizations consisting of leading global academics and engineers. They are committed to making this technology secure, scalable and flexible for millions of users.
                        <br><br>
                        Cardano will use the proof of stake mechanism to validate transactions. In contrast to the proof of work used by bitcoin and ethereum, this is much more energy efficient as no computing power has to be put into solving a task. Instead, an ADA is randomly selected to verify a slot (block) in which transactions are contained. If this block is accepted by the block chain at the exact time it is requested, there will be a reward. But to have a better chance to create a block the staking pools come into play. As an ADA owner you can delegate them to a pool, the more you delegate to a pool, the more chances you have to get rewards. This pool must be online at the time and verify the block. Since I am so overwhelmed by the philosophies of cardano I want to do my part and run a staking pool. As we are only at the beginning of this new technology, in october 2019 the test phase for the staking algorithm started and since then I run my pool on a Linux server. To ensure that my pool creates blocks it needs a constant maintenance and monitoring of my server and to make this easier I wrote small scripts.
